I wrote this when realised that I needed some way to tell if my nightly backups were completing successfully.

SuperDuper! runs ```log_backup_pre.sh``` when it begins backing up and then ```log_backup.sh``` when the backup is complete.

####Example line saved to my log file:

````Backup successfully completed at Sat May 28 03:37:58 CEST 2011 and took 00:37:27 to complete````
